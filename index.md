The 2022 NDSS workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR '22) is Sunday, April 24, 2022. A link to the official BAR program is available [here](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-program/bar-2022/). The goal of BAR is to facilitate discussion around novel research, tools, and emerging perspectives in analysis of binaries. The [call for papers](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2022/cfp-bar-workshop/) outlines organization, focus, and topics of specific interest. This website serves to archive paper preprints and links to their corresponding artifacts.
